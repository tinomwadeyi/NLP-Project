# NLP-Project

Python NLP code to analyze excel data and find links between incidents. As a software development intern and project manager for the project, it has been developed on my own as a way of trying to impove current business processes.

The project utilizes various functionalities of the natural language tool kit (NLTK) and fuzzywuzzy available through Python. These include:
  - Tokenization
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopwords removal
  - Process.extract
  - Fuzz.ratio
